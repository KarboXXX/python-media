# About
This project is about a python script that tells basic information about YouTube videos and download them as a **.mp4** file format. I'm planning on make this project light as possible, and possibly add downloader for other websites too, currently working on one for Instagram and Twitter.

# Installation
First, we need to clone this repository. As there aren't any functions on the script to make it auto-update itself, you can choose whenever you want to check for updates! Keep in mind you will need **Python 3** or above to run this script, the tested and debugged version used to make this project was **v3.9.8** as mentioned in the tags on top of this **README** file.
```
git clone https://github.com/KarboXXX/python-media.git
```
```
cd python-media
```
And now, we need to install our python package dependecies in the **requirements.txt** file, running:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
If you're on **Linux** and lazy like me, you can just:
```
git clone https://github.com/KarboXXX/python-media.git && cd python-media && pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, you ready to go! Make sure to run ```python3 main.py``` for help.

## Compatibility
Please, if you run this project on your computer, and it doesn't work, [**report it**](https://github.com/KarboXXX/python-media/issues), and help me to improve my coding! Any tips for performance or making the code look better are welcome as well!
