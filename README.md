# About
This project is about a python script that says basic information about YouTube videos and download them as a **.mp4** file format. I'm planning on make this project light as possible, and possibly add downloader for other websites other than YouTube, currently working on one for Instagram and then Twitter.

# Installation
First, we need to clone this repository. As there aren't any functions on the script to make it auto update itself, you can choose whenever you want to check for updates! Keep in mind you will need **Python 3** or above to run this script, the tested and debugged version used to make this project was **v3.9.8** as mentioned in the tags on top of this **README** file.
```
git clone https://github.com/KarboXXX/python-media.git
```
```
cd python-media
```
And now, we need to install our python package dependecies in the **requirements.txt** file, running:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
If you're on **Linux** and lazy like me, you can just:
```
git clone https://github.com/KarboXXX/python-media.git && cd python-media && pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, you ready to go! Make sure to run ```python3 main.py``` for help.

## Compatibility
Please, if you run this project on your computer, and it don't work, [**report it**](https://github.com/KarboXXX/python-media/issues), and help me to improve my coding! Any tips for performance or making the code look better are welcome as well!
